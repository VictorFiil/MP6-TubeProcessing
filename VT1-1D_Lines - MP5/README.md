1. Insert the images into Png2Ply\Insert_Images
2. Run Png2Ply\main.py to construct pointclouds of the images
3. Run PCC.ipynb to combine every pointcloud into a single pointcloud
4. Run MainCodeJupitor.ipynb to handle the data
5. Remember to delete old pictures before trying 1. again. Everything else takes care of itself.
